Step 5
Remove both the horizontal and vertical scrollbars, and prevent programmatic scrolling, using only one property. You should give body an overflow of clip.

Step 15
To prevent the mountain from pushing the .ground element, adjust its position to prevent it from taking up space in the page layout. You should give .left-mountain a position of absolute.

Step 16
To make the mountain look more like a mountain, you can use the skew transform function, which takes two arguments. The first being an angle to shear the x-axis by, and the second being an angle to shear the y-axis by.
Use the transform property to skew the mountain by 0deg in the x-axis and 44deg in the y-axis.

transform-origin: top left; 

transform: rotate(130deg) scaleX(-1);

Step 100
Use the wave animation on the left arm. Have the animation last 3s, infinitely iterate, and have a linear timing function.
  transform: rotate(130deg) scaleX(-1);
  animation-name: wave;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
